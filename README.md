![image](./public/image/mainpage.png)

A game project called HandBattle made using JavaScript, React, and CSS. It follows the same rules as the classic Rock, Paper, Scissors game. Users can select one of the items (Rock, Paper, Scissors), and the computer randomly selects one item. The outcome can be Win, Lose, or Tie. If the result is Win, the user scores 1 point. Scores can be reset at any time using the Reset button.
